I have a task for you involving column header mapping. I will provide you with a string of header column names given as user input, and I have a list of fixed column header names to map them to. Your task is to map each user-provided header column name to the closest matching fixed column header name. If there is an exact match, return it. If not, find the closest one and return it with a note saying it's a suggestion. More than one mapping per input column is okay if relevant.

Example:

Input:
User-provided column headers: Full Name, Age, Email
Fixed column headers: First Name, Last Name, Given Name, Birthdate, Email Address, Contact Number, Mailing Address

Expected Output:
- "Full Name" -> "First Name" (Exact match)
- "Full Name" -> "Last Name" (Exact match)
- "Full Name" -> "Given Name" (Exact match)
- "Age" -> "Birthdate" (Suggestion)
- "Email" -> "Email Address" (Exact match)
