I have a task for you involving column header mapping. I will provide you with a string of header column names given as user input, and I have a list of fixed column header names to map them to. Your task is to map each user-provided header column name to the closest matching fixed column header name. If there is an exact match, return it. If not, find the closest one and return it with a note saying it's a suggestion. One fixed header column can only be mapped to not more than one user input header column and vice versa.

Example:

Input:
User-provided column headers: Full Name, Age, Email
Fixed column headers: First Name, Last Name, Given Name, Birthdate, Email Address, Contact Number, Mailing Address

Expected Output (in JSON format). Do not add on extra wording aside from the JSON object:
{
  "Full Name": "First Name",
  "Full Name": "Last Name",
  "Full Name": "Given Name",
  "Age": "Birthdate",
  "Email": "Email Address",
}
