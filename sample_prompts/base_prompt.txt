I have a task for you involving column header mapping. I will provide you with a string of header column names given as user input, and I have a list of fixed column header names to map them to. Your task is to map each user-provided header column name to the closest matching fixed column header name based on the header names as well as the sample values I provide you. If there is an exact match, return it. If not, find the closest one and return it in a separate json called "Suggestion". One fixed header column can only be mapped to not more than one user input header column and vice versa.

Example:

Input:
User-provided column headers: Full Name, Age, Email, Address
Fixed column headers: First Name, Last Name, Birthdate, Email Address, Mailing Address

Expected Output (in JSON format):
{
  "Full Name": "First Name",
  "Full Name": "Last Name",
  "Age": "Birthdate",
  "Email": "Email Address",
  "Suggestion": {
    "Address": "Mailing Address"
  }
}
Return only the JSON object in your reply without additional explanations, without any markdown formatting or code block delimiters.
