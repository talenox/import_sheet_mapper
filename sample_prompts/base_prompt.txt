I have a task for you involving column header mapping. I will provide you with a string of header column names given as user input, and I have a list of fixed column header names to map them to. Your task is to map each user-provided header column name to the closest matching fixed column header name based on the header names as well as the sample values I provide you. If there is an exact match, return it. If not, find the closest one and return it with '(suggestion)' appended to the end. One fixed header column can only be mapped to not more than one user input header column and vice versa.

Example:

Input:
User-provided column headers: Full Name, Age, Email
Fixed column headers: First Name, Last Name, Given Name, Birthdate, Email Address, Contact Number, Mailing Address

Expected Output (in JSON format):
{
  "Full Name": "First Name",
  "Full Name": "Last Name",
  "Full Name": "Given Name",
  "Age": "Birthdate",
  "Email": "Email Address",
}
Return only the JSON object in your reply without additional explanations, without any markdown formatting or code block delimiters.
